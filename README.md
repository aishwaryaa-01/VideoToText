YouTube Transcript Summarizer

The YouTube Transcript Summarizer is a web-based tool built using Flask that allows users to extract, view, and summarize the transcript of any YouTube video. The application fetches the transcript of a video using the YouTube Transcript API, displays the original transcript, and generates a concise summary using traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The tool enables users to input a YouTube video URL, specify the number of sentences desired in the summary, and get both the full transcript and the summarized version displayed on the web page.

This project is designed to be a helpful resource for those who need to quickly understand or extract key points from a YouTube video without watching the entire content. The summary is generated by analyzing the frequency of words in the transcript, ranking the sentences based on their significance, and then selecting the most important ones for a clear, readable summary.

Key Features:
Transcript Extraction: Extracts YouTube video transcripts using the YouTube Transcript API.
Text Summarization: Summarizes the transcript using NLP techniques like sentence scoring based on word frequency.
User-friendly Interface: Simple form-based input where users can paste a YouTube video URL and specify the summary length.
Responsive Design: The app is mobile-friendly and works across devices.
Both Original and Summarized Transcript: Displays both the full transcript and the summary for easy comparison.
This project can be a useful tool for students, researchers, content creators, or anyone who needs to quickly extract and summarize information from YouTube videos.
